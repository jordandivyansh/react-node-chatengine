# Project README

After cloning the repository, follow the instructions in the README files located in the 'frontend' and 'backend' folders respectively.

- For frontend setup, navigate to the 'frontend' folder and follow the instructions in its README file.
- For backend setup, navigate to the 'backend' folder and follow the instructions in its README file.

Please note that you should create .env files separately in each folder if required, but ensure they are not committed to the repository.

Happy coding!"
